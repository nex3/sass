  Various text editors have various levels of support for Sass.
  Here's a list of all of them that I know of.
  If you create or learn of another or a more updated version,
  please email [sass-lang@googlegroups.com](mailto:sass-lang@googlegroups.com).

  Sass gets new syntax every now and then.
  This means that most of these modes are at least a little out-of-date.
  If anyone wants to take on the task of updating an old mode,
  that would be greatly appreciated.

    This is a snapshot of the site that used to host the plugin,
    so it may be a bit confusing to get it working.
    The [EclipseColorer plugin](http://colorer.sourceforge.net/eclipsecolorer/)
    by [Igor Russkih](http://cail.nm.ru/)
    also has support for coloring Haml and Sass.

    **[Emacs for Sass](http://github.com/nex3/sass-mode/tree/master/sass-mode.el)**
    by [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com).
    The Sass mode is probably the most up-to-date,
    since it's maintained by the Sass maintainer.
