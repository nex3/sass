  Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS
  that's used to describe the style of a document
  cleanly and structurally,
  with more power than flat CSS allows.
  Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS
  and implements various features that are useful
  for creating manageable stylesheets.
